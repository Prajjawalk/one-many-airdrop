# DropCaster

### **A one-to-many cross-chain swap hook for airdrops**

We have created a tool to perform one-to-many cross-chain token transfers in a single transaction. The tool is built on top of the Uniswap V4 pool where the user provides the input token A and a list of addresses he wants to airdrop, the DropCaster swaps Token A <> Token B, and Token B is equally distributed to all the addresses.

The token transfer takes place in the Flashloan accounting pattern where the token is first distributed among the addresses from pool and then the user settles the amount owed to pool. We have also integrated Hyperlane to enable cross-chain distribution of the tokens from uniswap pool.

DropCaster is an awesome tool for airdrops, and we have created an interface where anybody can airdrop their favourite tokens among the nearby wallets within common bluetooth range.

# Technical summary

The main technologies used to build DropCaster are:-

1. Uniswap V4 hooks
2. Hyperlane

The DropCaster is built on top of Uniswap v4 hook where we have used afterSwap hook to distribute the output tokens when the user successfully performs the swap of Token A to Token B. The afterSwap performs the flash accounting where the tokens are "taken" from the pool and distributed to receivers. The user then settles the balance using native token. Along with the addresses of the receivers, their receiving chain ID is also specified and cross chain transfer is performed using Hyperlane to the receivers who want to receive on different chain ID.

## Check Forge Installation

_Ensure that you have correctly installed Foundry (Forge) and that it's up to date. You can update Foundry by running:_

```
foundryup
```

## Set up

_requires [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh)_

```
forge install
forge test
```

### Local Development (Anvil)

Other than writing unit tests (recommended!), you can only deploy & test hooks on [anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/)

```bash
# start anvil, a local EVM chain
anvil

# in a new terminal
forge script script/Anvil.s.sol \
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
    --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
    --broadcast
```

<summary><h3>Testnets</h3></summary>

NOTE: 11/21/2023, the Goerli deployment is out of sync with the latest v4. **It is recommend to use local testing instead**

~~For testing on Goerli Testnet the Uniswap Foundation team has deployed a slimmed down version of the V4 contract (due to current contract size limits) on the network.~~

~~The relevant addresses for testing on Goerli are the ones below~~

```bash
POOL_MANAGER = 0x0
POOL_MODIFY_POSITION_TEST = 0x0
SWAP_ROUTER = 0x0
```

Update the following command with your own private key:

```
forge script script/00_Counter.s.sol \
--rpc-url https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_goerli \
--private-key [your_private_key_on_goerli_here] \
--broadcast
```

### _Deploying your own Tokens For Testing_

Because V4 is still in testing mode, most networks don't have liquidity pools live on V4 testnets. We recommend launching your own test tokens and expirementing with them that. We've included in the templace a Mock UNI and Mock USDC contract for easier testing. You can deploy the contracts and when you do you'll have 1 million mock tokens to test with for each contract. See deployment commands below

```
forge create script/mocks/mUNI.sol:MockUNI \
--rpc-url [your_rpc_url_here] \
--private-key [your_private_key_on_goerli_here]
```

```
forge create script/mocks/mUSDC.sol:MockUSDC \
--rpc-url [your_rpc_url_here] \
--private-key [your_private_key_on_goerli_here]
```

<summary><h2>Troubleshooting</h2></summary>

### _Permission Denied_

When installing dependencies with `forge install`, Github may throw a `Permission Denied` error

Typically caused by missing Github SSH keys, and can be resolved by following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

Or [adding the keys to your ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent), if you have already uploaded SSH keys

### Hook deployment failures

Hook deployment failures are caused by incorrect flags or incorrect salt mining

1. Verify the flags are in agreement:
   - `getHookCalls()` returns the correct flags
   - `flags` provided to `HookMiner.find(...)`
2. Verify salt mining is correct:
   - In **forge test**: the *deploye*r for: `new Hook{salt: salt}(...)` and `HookMiner.find(deployer, ...)` are the same. This will be `address(this)`. If using `vm.prank`, the deployer will be the pranking address
   - In **forge script**: the deployer must be the CREATE2 Proxy: `0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C`
     - If anvil does not have the CREATE2 deployer, your foundry may be out of date. You can update it with `foundryup`
